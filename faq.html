    <p>
      The May/June introductory classes will take place
      at <a href="https://suite-genius.com/mt-pleasant/"
      target="_blank">
      Suite Genius
      Mount Pleasant</a>, near the Broadway-City Hall Skytrain
      station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The classes will take place after school, once or twice a
      week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exact dates will be determined after May 15, so
      we can accomodate the schedules of registered
      students.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, we will take it from there for
      when and where to hold the summer program!
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Who will teach the class?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eihsu" target="_blank">Eric
      Hsu</a> will lead the first classes, and more instructors will come
      on later according to demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;“My academic background
      is in artificial intelligence, but a few years ago I went back
      into industry, building software systems for startups in San
      Francisco and Boston.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve taught programming for
      software engineers, and computer science at
      university.&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve also taught leadership at military
      school, P.E. for first-graders, and will start coaching
      beginners at Vancouver Rowing Club this summer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
      moved to Vancouver one year ago with my wife, who took a job
      at UBC, and started working  remotely for a U.S. company while
      waiting for Canadian residency.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I have a work
      permit, but miss teaching!&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I love the general
      attitude of the newest generation of people and am jealous of
      all the opportunities and resources they have now for going
      through life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The program will also use online computer science courses made
      available by universities with track records of successful
      undergraduate education.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most importantly, though,
      students will work together to explore the material and pursue
      their own understanding as a cohort.

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">How is a computer science class different from a “learn to code” camp?
    &nbsp;&nbsp;What is the difference between coding and computer science?
  </div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Students will learn both coding, and computer science as a whole: a
      lot of coders know some computer science and wish they knew more; most
      computer scientists can code, but they would certainly like to code
      better.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coding uses existing and emerging programming
      languages to create apps or backend software or user interfaces that
      people can use on their computing platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;Computer
      science figures out new things that can/can’t be computed
      (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undecidable_problem"
	  target="_blank">not everything can be computed</a>!) and the
      techniques for doing so in the best (fastest, most reliable,
      cheapest) way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      An analogy is that a lot of people can drive a car, just as a
      lot of people can use a computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, a master
      mechanic can not only operate, or repair, or customize a car,
      but can even make a new one from mixed parts, just as coders can
      extend existing software applications, or create entirely new
      ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;A computer scientist is more like an automotive
      engineer, in terms of designing new kinds of vehicles,
      understanding what makes them faster (or safer, or easier to
      build), and creating new parts that mechanics can
      use.&nbsp;&nbsp;So figuring out how to make a personal assistant
      like <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/silicon-superego/"
      target="_blank">Siri</a> understand what you are saying is more
      about computer science, and building Siri is more about coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      A final distinction is that some shorter-term coding camps are more
      about quickly getting a small demo project working using
      pre-built templates or beginners' platforms
      (<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">like the most excellent Scratch
      language</a>.)&nbsp;&nbsp;This could be compared to assembling a
      model car from a kit: it is a practical and achievable
      short-term goal, and a great way to get familiar with cars (or
      computers) and learn something about how they
      work.&nbsp;&nbsp;But over a longer course of time the Bluesoxx
      program will go beyond simple projects so participants can
      create realistic programs built with the same tools, methods,
      and theoretical foundations used by professionals.
    </p>

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What is the minimum experience level for the course?
</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      No experience is required to take the course.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">
    How will this girls-only program differ from a co-ed one?
  </div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Most everyone who has worked with women, or studied women,
      or met a woman, or who is a woman, has some sort of
      understanding about how women are different from men and how
      women can be successful in different ways.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, the
      Bluesoxx program has no doctrine about the best way to teach
      girls, and no policy regarding their relationship with
      technology and society, except that the course is currently open
      only to people who identify as female and attend a
      Vancouver-area secondary school.

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Will it be fun?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few lessons you will be able make some
      basic things like a professional-style (i.e. not from a
      template) web page, or a word-guessing game like “Hangman”, or a
      never-ending drawing like the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierpinski_triangle"
      target="_blank">Sierpiński Triangle</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, you will have to work, too: we won’t be doing a kid’s
      version of programming where you can quickly make something from
      a kit to show your parents but nobody wants to explain how it
      works.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is kind of like taking piano lessons: it’s
      not fun just start playing on a piano when you don’t know how to
      play.&nbsp;&nbsp;But, it is fun to work out how to do something
      that you can't do, and then do it!&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting good at
      something over time can more fun than something that is just
      entertaining.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, you will be doing it with your
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      The opportunity to work with your friends and accomplish things
      together is one advantage over the specific example of playing
      the piano.  Also, once you get started there are more resources
      to get really good on your own, without always having to meet up
      with a teacher to progress.  (Playing the piano is surely a lot
      of fun for many people, too!)
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Why might I be motivated to learn computer science?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      If you already know of something that you enjoy learning more
      than computer science, then you should go ahead and do that for
      sure!
    </p>
    <p>
      If, most likely, you are unsure how much you enjoy C.S., then come out
      and see if you like it!&nbsp;&nbsp;One way describing it is that
      programming is like building something the way you want using facts
      and logic instead of persuasion or authority (like when you are
      debating something with your friends, versus with people who are
      younger or older than you), and that computer science is
      programming plus solving puzzles by figuring out the "trick" to
      making them work (like when you have your own favorite way
      of arranging your candies in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candy_Crush_Saga"
      target="_blank">Candy Crush</a>.)
    </p>
    <p>
      If it turns out that computer science is for you, then luckily
      you will be able to do something you like while transforming
      almost every part of the world, not just the computer
      industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the newest and most important
      trends in a variety of areas require an understanding of
      computer science:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  If you want to work in arts or entertainment, you can create
	  digital art and animation
	  <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">using
	  programming</a>, or use algorithms to
	  <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/"
	  target="_blank">predict</a> what kinds of movies people want
	  to watch.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you want to work in biology, or medicine, you can
	  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology"
	  target="_blank">use computation</a> to create new kinds of
	  devices and programs to study people’s DNA and find a treatment
	  for their condition.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you want to work in literature you can use books to
	  understand the purpose of life by scanning them all into a
	  database and then <a href="https://litlab.stanford.edu/"
	  target="_blank">analyzing them with a computer</a>. 
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you like nature you can discourage humans from destroying
	  it by trying to
	  <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/"
	  target="_blank">convince</a> them that they are doing so.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you like sports you can use sensors and computers to
	  <a href="http://www.sloansportsconference.com/"
	  target="_blank">figure out</a> how your team can train
	  better or play better and win more games.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you want to do something that nobody has ever done
	  before, there is a good chance that you will have to use a
	  computer.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you end up working primarily in a field that is not directly
	  related to computation, it is still pretty straightforward to
	  <a href="http://www.lyndseyscott.com" target="_blank">write
	  some apps in your spare time</a>.
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you want to travel the world telling young women how to
	  empower themselves and improve their lives by taking charge,
	  maybe you don’t have to study computer science&hellip;maybe
	  <a href="http://leanin.org/book"
	  target="_blank">go into management</a> (and work really hard!)
	</li>
	<li>
	  If you don’t like to work you can program for fun, or go to
	  grad school in computer science and do whatever you feel
	  like (only partly joking.)
	</li>
	</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, you can make good income working with computers in the
      future, and live a fun life in the city you want,
      (<a href="http://www.remoteyear.com/" target="_blank">or while
      travelling around the world</a>), at least compared to being
      dependent on other people for money&mdash;you could also make
      mega-money by inventing a company or technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;(If you
      already know that you don’t like C.S., but you need a solid
      salary, like, to provide for your family, then you should also
      learn C.S. but that is a pretty grim scenario indeed for a high
      school student.)

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What can I expect to accomplish from these courses?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      After a couple of classes, you will start to understand how
      computers work, and be able to write some very simple
      programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you choose to stay on for a something
      like 12 weeks, you will have the same computer science ability
      as a computer science major doing their first year at a university
      like Harvey Mudd, MIT, or Stanford (because we will be using their
      actual courses.)
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">What if I can already program?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      If you can already write programs, you will get to learn about
      the computer science algorithms and technologies that
      programming is based on, which will multiply your ability to do
      new things.&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of programming tasks, you will
      sometimes get a more challenging version of what everyone else
      is working on&mdash;the rest of the time you will get to carry
      out a time-honored and equally beneficial tradition in the
      history of computers: sharing what you’ve learned with others. 
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Is there really physical exercise?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Yah, one of the drawbacks of working with computers is that in
      the long term it can take a toll on your health and
      fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we will maintain a habit taking fifteen
      minutes per class for something like yoga or the seven-minute
      workout, or some other exercise that you will lead.

  <div class="faq-q">Why should I be motivated for my offspring to learn computer science?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Learning C.S. might be really fun and interesting for your
      child, and also provide a means for them to pursue the career
      they want in a variety of fields in the future (a few examples
      are listed above in the Students' section).&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Most children are aware early on as to whether they
      enjoy tumbling, dancing, fashion, or fighting, without taking
      gymnastics, ballet, sewing, or mixed-martial-arts classes first;
      but it may not be immediately obvious whether they will enjoy a
      less traditional activity, like computer science.&nbsp;&nbsp;So,
      it is worth at least trying out!
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">
    Will a class like this help / hinder my child with getting into university?
  </div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      Though the program is structured as a class, the best way to think of
      it as an extra-curricular activity like music lessons, sports,
      volunteering, or working a summer job.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if your
      child does not enjoy the program, making them take it will
      hinder them <i>in life</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it turns out that they do like computer science, it is definitely
      an under-appreciated means of enriching the standard offerings
      at most secondary schools, and in turn improving your child's
      chances for getting into a famous school.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some parents are
      really concerned about marks and taking time away from
      study&hellip;but for the schools with tightest admissions rates, most
      applicants have pretty good marks already&mdash;a better
      differentiator might be working on something like a science
      project, a personal hobby, a non-profit organization, or a global
      open-source project, potentially using computer science ability.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="faq-pair">
  <div class="faq-q">Why shouldn't my child just take some coding classes online?</div>
  <div class="faq-a">
    <p>
      There are some excellent educational resources available online,
      mostly at no cost; we can definitely recommend some appropriate
      options for anyone who does not want to join in the
      course!&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, the Bluesoxx program is built on many
      of these resources, so a more direct question might be, <i>"Why
      shouldn’t my child just take some classes online <b>by
      herself</b>?"</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyone who has taken an online computer science class&mdash;or
      built pretty much anything on a computer on their own, has
      probably shared the same experience with millions of beginning
      and expert users around the world: 90% of your project goes
      smoothly, the way it is supposed to; and 10% totally doesn’t
      make sense and is almost impossible to solve without help.&nbsp;&nbsp;
      (Often, that 10% is the first 10% of the project!)&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      opportunity to consult with fellow students, along with expert
      instructors, is key to cruising past obstacles that can
      otherwise dominate the entire learning experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, technical competence in and of itself is not
      professionally or personally profitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Telling your
      child to just learn computer science online is comparable, on a
      smaller scale, to telling them to just go to university online.
    </p>
    <p>
      Professionally, simply knowing how to do a task is not the same as knowing how
      to communicate with peers and stakeholders, how to identity new
      opportunities and problems that need solving, how to clarify
      requirements and manage expectations, or knowing how to ask the right
      question to get the right information at the right
      time.&nbsp;&nbsp;(This may explain why so many technically
      proficient individuals are repeatedly cheated out of
      professional opportunities&mdash;by a combination of wrongfully and
      rightfully assessed factors of this kind.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Personally, it can be ungratifying indeed to excel at something
      without the opportunity to teach and to be taught, to build
      inter-personal relationships, and to at least share your trials and
      accomplishments with some of part the wider
      world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everybody in the world can be friends, but
      at the same time human beings do not seem to have evolved to
      perform solitary labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as much as modern
      commerce is driven by mass production, and as much as this is
      reflected in the economic drive to extend automation into
      education, human mentorship and collaborative learning cannot
      currently be replaced by IT.  
    </p>
    <p>
      By these arguments, your child can definitely learn almost anything
      online on their own, including computer science; but it will take a
      lot longer and they will be missing out on many opportunities for
      personal enrichment.
